# Grocery Store Product Forecasting Challenge by [AI Hack](https://ai-hack-tunisia.com/)

Can you forecast the number of products sold per store per week for a local grocery store?

## Description

Sales forecasting is the foundation of a businessâ€™s financial story. Once you have your sales forecast you can create profit and loss statements, cash flow statements and balance sheets, thus helping you set goals for your company. Proper forecasting also ensures you have the right stock at all times and leads to less wasted stock.

Having the skill to create a sales forecast will help you manage anything from a small business up to a large company, where you need to inform investors about your forecasts for a months, quarter or a year.

The objective of this challenge is to create a model to forecast the number of products purchased per week per store over the next eight weeks, for grocery stores located in different areas in the same country. The solution to this challenge can be used by small chain stores to know how much stock to order per week and per month.
